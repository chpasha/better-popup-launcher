Tuscoss Popup Launcher was built upon the old KDE Popup Launcher, with the following improvements:

1. You can add separators to the menu (separators can be thin lines, or spaces);
2. The position of the apps in the configuration window can be changed by dragging the apps, rather than the arrow-click tiny menu previously available;
3. The Panel tooltip actually works, and you can set a subtitle to it;
3. You can pick an icon for the panel using the KDE icon picker, rather than browsing the File open dialog;
4. The versions of most components imported into the Plasmoid have been updated.
