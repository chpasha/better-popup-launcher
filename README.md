**Better Popup Launcher** is a Plasmoid for KDE Plasma 5, built upon [Popup Launcher](https://github.com/dfaust/plasma-applet-popup-launcher).

It adds an icon to the KDE Panel, which loads a menu with application shortcuts, as selected by the user.

Compared to the original Plasmoid, it comes with the following improvements:

1. You can <ins>add separators</ins> to the menu (separators can be thin lines, or spaces);
2. The position of the apps in the configuration window can be changed by <ins>drag and drop</ins>, rather than by arrow-clicking the tiny menu previously available (now no longer included);
3. The Panel <ins>tooltip</ins> actually works, and you can set a subtitle to it (did not work previously);
3. You can pick an icon for the panel using the KDE <ins>icon picker</ins>, rather than browsing the File open dialog;
4. The versions of most components imported into the Plasmoid have been <ins>updated</ins>.
